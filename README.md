## How to Play

1. The game starts with Player 1 (O) and Player 2 (X) taking turns.
2. On your turn, enter the number corresponding to the cell where you want to place your symbol.
3. The grid cells are numbered 1 to 9 as follows:

    ```
     1 | 2 | 3
    -----------
     4 | 5 | 6
    -----------
     7 | 8 | 9
    ```

4. The game checks for a winner or a draw after each move.
5. The game ends when a player gets three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or when all cells are filled without any player winning (draw).
